%h2 Class09 Answer:
%h2 In Django, what does this syntax do:

.syntax
  %pre
    %code {% extends "base.html" %}

%p I found the above syntax in this file:

%p
  %a(href='https://github.com/danbikle/dj101/blob/master/hello/templates/index.html' target='x')
    https://github.com/danbikle/dj101/blob/master/hello/templates/index.html

%p When I see the above syntax I think of an HTML sandwich.

%p I have HTML-bread on the outside and HTML-syntax inside.

%p I place the above syntax in the inside file and it helps me declare that "base.html" is the bread.

%p If I want to see the actual HTML-bread, I look here:
%p
  %a(href='https://github.com/danbikle/dj101/blob/master/hello/templates/base.html' target='x')
    https://github.com/danbikle/dj101/blob/master/hello/templates/base.html
    
%p When I study the above file, I see syntax near the bottom which declares where "index.html" gets inserted inside the HTML-sandwich.

%p To answer the original question I say,

.syntax
  %pre
    %code {% extends "base.html" %}
%p allows me to reuse the syntax inside "base.html" to surround any HTML-template.

%p Remember, code-reuse is one of the main features of Django:
