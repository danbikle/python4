This script should Compare a Python Comprehension to a For-Loop

import pdb

# I should create a list to be shared by Comprehension and For-Loop:
a_l = [0.1, 1.2, 2.3, 3.4]

# I should demo a For-Loop:
b_l = []
for a_f in a_l:
    b_f = a_f * 2
    b_l.append(b_f)

# I should demo a Comprehension:
c_l = [a_f * 2 for a_f in a_l]

# I should Compare Comprehension to For-Loop:
print(b_l)
print(c_l)

# Often a Comprehension has sweeter syntax than a For-Loop.
