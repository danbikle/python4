<h1>Introduction to JavaScript Programming</h1>
<p>
In this class we start your JavaScript learning experience with Node.js which is the best way to learn basics of the JavaScript language.
Node.js is an example of "server-side" JavaScript.
We use Node.js to introduce some JavaScript basics: Variables, Data-Types, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Objects, Math, Strings and Dates.
Node.js also gives you the opportunity to learn the operation of JavaScript editors like SublimeText3, Vim, Emacs, and gedit.
After you can write and run simple Node.js scripts, we use Node.js to run a web server on your laptop which allows you to enter the world of "client-side" JavaScript.
Here, you use a browser to load and execute JavaScript (from the Node.js server) which interacts with simple HTML in the browser.  JavaScript running in your browser is "client-side" JavaScript.
We use "client-side" JavaScript to revisit basics introduced via "server-side" JavaScript.
Next we use both types of JavaScript to learn more advanced attributes of the language:
Scope, Events, Regular Expressions, Error Handling, JSON, Automated Testing, Promises, Async/Await.
Additionally we make use of sophisticated libraries to transform basic JavaScript knowledge into useful applications: jQuery, Vue.js, and D3.js.
Finally we teach you how to deploy your JavaScript applications to Heroku (for $0) so billions of people can see your work.
If time permits, we will cover the use of JavaScript and JSON to interact with MongoDB which can be used to store vast amounts of data on the internet.
