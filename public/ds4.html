<h1>Introduction to Data Science Using Software and Statistics</h1>
<p>
In this class we introduce you to Data Science by showing you how to
use open-source software to solve word problems from Statistics and
Probability.  We start each problem with a data acquisition task.
Next we engage in exploratory data visualization to gain understanding
about the acquired data.  Then, we ask a question usually related to
forecasting or predictions derivable from the data.  Finally, we
attempt to both answer the question and somehow quantify the
confidence or quality of the answer.  Perhaps also the answer will
require a visualization component, constructed from software operated
by you.  The software we use includes spreadsheets, Wolfram-Alpha,
Python, SageMath, R, D3.js, SQLite and Postgres. A Data Scientist
should be able to write simple programs. If you can program, great;
else we will teach you some programming.  The Statistics and
Probability we use in the class is introductory college level.  If
your Statistics knowledge is weak, you will benefit much from this
course of study because we will teach it to you.
