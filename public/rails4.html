<h1>Introduction to Web Development with Ruby on Rails 5.1</h1>
<p>
  This class introduces you to the four pillars of Web Development:
  HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Server Programming.  Your learning
  experience starts via the setup of a training environment inside a
  Linux machine.  After you create your training environment, you learn
  enough Server Programming to deploy a pre-created Web-app to the
  internet for $0.  After you understand that process, you move into an
  iterative training cycle that teaches you a modest amount of HTML,
  CSS, JavaScript, and Rails-API.  At the end of each cycle you deploy a
  Web-app to the internet. Each training cycle lasts anywhere from 30
  minutes to 3 hours.  After 10 training cycles, you will be at the end
  of the class; you should know enough technology to deploy a web-app
  which supports a login page and multiple roles for users after they
  login to your web-app.  Advanced students will make the leap into
  E-Commerce which allows them to setup a shopping cart to sell digital
  goods and collect money via APIs from Stripe or Shopify.
